        <h1>Why Go To Glacier National Park</h1>
        <p>Named for the remnants of glaciers from the ice age, Glacier National Park is located on the border of Canada and Montana. It is often called the "Crown of the Continent," because of its dizzying array of natural beauty. A favorite spot among hikers, the park features a variety of trails for all skill levels, ranging from the easy Trail of the Cedars (home to towering and beautiful cedars) to the challenging Grinnell Glacier (which offers sweeping views). What's more, the park boasts more than 700 lakes, numerous waterfalls and two mountain ranges, spread across more than 1 million acres that shelter a variety of wildlife. </p>
        <p>Aside from its breathtaking geological features, it's also home to a fair amount of history. The Going-to-the-Sun Road – a scenic, 50-mile drive through the park – is a National Historic Landmark and an engineering marvel that offers spectacular views, as well as access to popular hiking trails. Plus, many of the park's lodges, chalets and hotels were constructed by the Great Northern Railway in the early 20th century and are on the National Register of Historic Places. Care to visit a UNESCO World Heritage Site? You'll find that here, too: the Waterton-Glacier International Peace Park.

            To limit the number of people visiting the park, Glacier National Park implemented a ticketed entry system through Sept. 6, 2021 for certain park entrances. Visit the National Park Service's website for additional information.</p>
<h1>Things To Do in Glacier National Park</h1>
<h2>Going-to-the-Sun Road:</h2>
<center><img src="https://travel.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/b322027/2147483647/resize/976x652%5E%3E/crop/976x652/quality/85/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftravel.usnews.com%2Fimages%2Fgoing-to-the-sun_road_attraction_V42QdvL.jpg"width="300px" height="300px"</center>
<p>Going-to-the-Sun Road is a paved, two-lane highway that snakes through Glacier National Park, dividing the park into east and west regions and crossing the Continental Divide at Logan Pass. One of the most spectacular scenic drives in America, this road is both a National Historic Landmark and a Civil Engineering Landmark and passes through almost every type of terrain the park offers, from glacial lakes, waterfalls and cedar forests to alpine peaks. Several viewpoints and pullouts make it easy to stop and take in the view and snap photographs. For a more active way to see the sights, try biking along the road instead (but know that certain restrictions apply). Though portions of the 50-mile route are open year-round, the alpine sections do close due to snow. Generally, the road is fully open in late June or early July, but check the park website in advance. </p>

<p>Recent visitors called this scenic drive "breathtaking" and one of the most spectacular routes in Montana. Reviewers also cautioned that the twisting mountain road is not for timid drivers. Many warned about tourists gawking at the scenery instead of paying attention to the road and advised making use of the many pullouts for admiring the stunning scenery and wildlife. 

    Although the park service estimates driving the full road will take two hours, it'll likely take you much longer if you pause at the stop-off points to take photographs or enjoy the view. The speed limit on the lower portion of the route is 45 miles per hour, but slows to 25 in the higher elevations. Be sure to fill up your tank before entering the park, as there is no gas available inside the park. Pack a cooler with drinks and snacks, as restaurants are located at only a few points like Lake McDonald, Rising Sun and Apgar Village. Restrooms and water are available at the Logan Pass, Apgar and St. Mary visitor centers along the way. There are vehicle size restrictions, check the park website for specifics. Access to the drive is included in park admission.</p>
    <h2 align="left">Trail of the Cedars:</h2>
    <img align="right" src="https://travel.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/c5af954/2147483647/resize/976x652%5E%3E/crop/976x652/quality/85/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftravel.usnews.com%2Fimages%2FChris_LaBasco_PK02Fw6.jpg" width="200px" height="200px">
    <p>One of two wheelchair and stroller accessible trails in the park, Trail of the Cedars is a short loop hike – less than a mile – that begins and ends on Going-to-the-Sun Road, meaning you can hike it in either direction. The hike features a raised boardwalk that passes through a fragrant, old-growth red cedar forest, but the highlight is at the midway point. Here, you'll reach a footbridge over Avalanche Creek with beautiful views of the gorge and a stunning waterfall. The only downside? Since this easy hike is accessible to visitors of all skill levels, parking is often difficult to find during peak season (July to Labor Day). 

        Many recent visitors touted this trail as the best walk in the park, saying it's not only an easy, accessible path, but also offers breathtaking views of the gorge. Many recommend visiting early in the morning or late in the afternoon to avoid crowded parking lots, noting that the picnic grounds near McDonald Creek are a great place to break for lunch or dinner. Travelers also commented on the lovely cedar fragrance in this old-growth forest. Access to the trail is free with park admission. You'll find the trail about 5 miles northeast of Lake McDonald Lodge. You can also take the park's free shuttle to the Avalanche Creek stop.

        Tours & Sightsee</p>
        <h2 align="left">Red Bus Tours</h2>

    <p>Driving around Glacier is a spectacular way to see the sights – particularly along Going-to-the-Sun Road – but drivers may sometimes miss out, especially if they're behind the wheel. Let someone else do the driving by taking a famed Red Bus Tour. These chauffeured buses date back to the 1930s, and feature canvas rollback tops that offer unencumbered views of the surrounding landscape. Plus, each bus accommodates just 17 passengers.

        There are nine tour routes in total. Five depart from the east side of GNP, while four depart from the west side. Depending on which route you take, you could explore top sights like Lake McDonald Lodge, Logan Pass, St. Mary Valley and Two Medicine. You may also get to see the alpine areas of Going-to-the-Sun Road.</p>
        <p>Tour-takers commented that the bus is a great way to see the park. They added that it's much more relaxing than driving yourself. Many travelers also complimented the guides for their great driving and informative commentary. Others warn that you will need to book tickets well in advance as tours sell out quickly.

            Tours run during the peak season – typically from June through September or October – but exact dates will vary depending on the weather. Duration also varies by tour: They can last from about 2 ½ hours to eight hours. Fees vary based on tour and departure point. For short tours, expect tickets to start at $40 for adults and $20 for children. Daylong tours cost about $100 for adults and $50 for children. Tours depart from Many Glacier Hotel, Swiftcurrent Motor Inn, St. Mary Lodge and Rising Sun Motor Inn on the east side. On the west side, you can catch the tour at Lake McDonald Lodge, Apgar Visitor Center and the West Glacier KOA.
            
            Note: There are no physical nor virtual tickets for the tour. You will check in for your tour at your pickup point's front desk or concierge desk at least 15 minutes before the tour departs. For schedules and to purchase tickets, visit the Glacier National Park Lodges' website.</p>
